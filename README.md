# Welcome to My First Backend Mastery Project

Welcome to my first project on my backend mastery journey! This is the beginning of my exploration into the world of backend development. The core essence of backend development is **DATA**, and this project focuses on understanding how databases work and how to interact with them.

## Project Overview

This project is a Python Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to implement a simple database. It serves as an educational tool for me to understand how databases operate under the hood, including basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Key Features

- **CLI Interface**: A simple command-line tool to interact with the database.
- **Database Implementation**: A basic database system that can store, retrieve, update, and delete data.
- **Learning Goal**: To gain hands-on experience with databases and Python programming.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- File-based Database (or other relevant database system)
